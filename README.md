FF4j, is an implementation of the [Feature Toggle](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html) pattern.

## ü§òFeatures

- **Feature Toggle:** Enable and disable features at runtime - no deployments. Implement multiple paths in your code, protected by dynamic predicates (if/then/else).

- **Role-based Toggling:** In addition to enabling features with simple flag values, you can also determine access based on roles and groups (Canary Release). Different frameworks supported starting by Spring Security.

- **Strategy-based Toggling:** Determine whether features are enabled by implementing custom predicates via the Strategy Pattern. Some, like White/Black lists ,Time-based, and Expression-based, are already provided. You can also connect to an external source like a Drools rule engine.

- **AOP-driven Toggling:** Keep your code clean and readable: use annotations to avoid nested if statements. Thanks to Spring AOP target implementation is pick at runtime, and thus driven by feature statuses.

- **Features Monitoring:** For each feature's execution, FF4j evaluates the predicate. Therefore it's possible to record events and metrics to compute nice dashboards, or draw curves for features usage over time.

- **Audit Trail:** Each action (create, update, delete, toggles) can be traced and saved in the audit trail for troubleshooting. With permissions management (AuthorizationManager) it's possible to identify users.

- **Web Console:**
Administrate FF4j (including features and properties) with the web UI. Packaged as a servlet in the library, you will expose it in your backend applications. Almost 10 languages available.

- **Wide choice of Databases** Our pride: we support 20+ database technologies to store your features, properties and events. Same business model, multiple implementations. Thanks to extension points, it's easy to build your own.

- **Spring Boot Starter** Import the ff4j-spring-boot-starter dependency into your microservices to get the web console and REST API working immediately. (To be used for the backend app. Now compliant with Spring Boot 2x: üëâ SAMPLES

- **REST Api** Operate FF4j through a WEB API. This is the best way to use FF4j with others languages, especially when working with JavaScript front-ends.

- **Properties (CMDB)** In addition to a feature's status you can store any property value to create properties you can change at runtime. It is integrated with most frameworks like Spring, Archaius, commons-config or Consul.

- **(Distributed) Cache** Evaluating predicates may put pressure on your DB (high hit ratio) so FF4j provides local and distributed caches to help. (edit feature also evict cache). Leveraging JSR-107 it supports most cache solutions.

- **Command Line Interface** To support automating things, or because web ports may be blocked (you know, production...), you can work through SSH using our Command Line Interface (cli), our Shell #devOps. It will interact directly with storages.

- **JMX and MBeans** A limited set of operations can be performed through JMX. FF4j exposes some MBeans to read metrics or toggle features from external tools (Nagios...). Not all applications are web based -- batches, shell, standalone. etc.
